BMax - Borderless maximize any Window
=============

This little tray utility can be used to maximize any Windows application without their titlebar, borders or any other window decoration (like tiling window managers).

Currently, there is an option to keep either keep the taskbar visible or not, and I plan on adding more features like saving/restoring layouts and more.

The application should be compatible with any game/application that is capable of running in windowed mode.
