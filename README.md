BMax - Borderless Maximizer
=============

BMax is a utility that resides in the windows notification area. It's used to borderlessy maximize any Windows Application or Game to achieve a pseudo fullscreen effect. 

There are two modes of operation:
    - Strip mode: Strips the window of all its decoration like borders or title bar and attempt to maximize it. This mode works fine on most "normal" windows applications, but you may encounter games (like EVE Online) that act strange when their window gets stripped.
    - Resize mode: This mode keeps the window decorations and instead resizes the window to be bigger than the actual screen, effectively hiding the title bar and borders outside the visible screen. This mode is less harmful than the strip method, but has problems with applications that enforce a certain maximum window size.
